I've been working in print publishing and then digital media most of my career, later on as a production editor of weekly technical newspapers, editing monthly magazines, from artificial intelligence to desktop publishing, and in medical to construction titles. In 1995 I set up a website for an electronic engineering title and was given the pointy-hat title of **Webmaster** - highly popular at that time. 

Since then, I've worked in consultancy and freelanced as a web developer and producer, and over the period from the mid -90s observed the changes and growing of the internet from grey-background text pages with the occasional image, to the simply vast range of technologies, programming languages and frameworks and rich interactive interfaces which are now ubiquitous.

### What else?
I'm thankful to many people who have helped and mentored me along the way, both in the professional spheres and in my other areas of interest, and particularly music.
