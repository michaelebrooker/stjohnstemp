## Baptism
Baptism is the gateway to life in Christ and becoming a member of the Church. If you ever visit an ancient church, this is why you'll always find the font at the back of the church near the door.

If you would like to know more about Baptism for your child, please complete the [Baptism enquiry form](/baptism) We will put you in touch with a member of the Baptism Team who will meet with you, give you all the information you need and support you as explore this journey of faith.  Baptisms take place on the 2nd Sunday of each month.
 
If you are an adult newly come to faith in Jesus and would like to explore Baptism as a next step of faith, please speak with a member of the clergy after a Sunday gathering.

## Marriage

A wedding day marks the beginning of a whole new relationship called marriage, and the start of a life shared together.

St John's wants to join with those celebrating this new life, and to offer the best possible start to a strong and healthy marriage. So as well as planning for the wedding day at church, getting married at St John's also involves a time of preparation, based on Christian principles but equally applicable for those with or without Christian faith.

To enquire about having your wedding at St John's fill in our [Weddings at St Johns form](/weddings).

## Bereavement

The death of someone we love can be one of the most stressful and devastating events of our lives. It is a shocking and bewildering experience and not something to be ‘got over’ in a matter of weeks or months.

St John’s offers support through this difficult time, helping and enabling the saying of goodbyes, and walking alongside people as they begin to live with their loss.

We have ministers available to lead funeral services either at St John’s or at the Crematorium. Please ask your funeral director to contact us. A minister will then arrange to meet with you to talk about the style of service that will suit your needs best.

Following the funeral, a member of our Bereavement Team will contact you to see if there is any other way in which we can help. Our Bereavement Team members are fully trained and DBS checked.

If you would like to contact our Bereavement Team for support; whether the funeral of your loved one was conducted by St John’s or not, or whether your bereavement was recent or not, please contact the church office to arrange. 

Contact details are below.
