### Baptism
Baptism is the gateway to life in Christ and becoming a member of the Church. If you ever visit an ancient church, this is why you'll always find the font at the back of the church near the door.

If you would like to know more about Baptism for your child, please complete the Baptism enquiry form below. We will put you in touch with a member of the Baptism Team who will meet with you, give you all the information you need and support you as explore this journey of faith.  Baptisms take place on the 2nd Sunday of each month.

If you are an adult newly come to faith in Jesus and would like to explore Baptism as a next step of faith, please speak with a member of the clergy after a Sunday gathering.
