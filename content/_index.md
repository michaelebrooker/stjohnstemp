## You want a website: where do you start?
The web is now awash with technologies so confusing that even web developers in a quandary about which programming language to learn: there are so many. That's the truth. So how can those who want to a website for business or for a project, make sense of it all the different services and types of hosting on offer? Many web software companies - typically advertising on Youtube - claim to provide a drag 'n' drop website creation experience that almost anyone can build a successful website. This might be OK for some people, who don't mind the disadvantages, but if you want to present a professional experience, you will need to find a professional. There are no shortcuts.

## Too many choices, and too much information
If you are commissioning a website, don't get bamboozled with technology, but do check it is being built to current standards, using up-to-date software, which should include one of the major HTML frameworks: such as Bootstrap, or Foundation, but there are others. Using an HTML framework will make sure that all pages work in all types of browsers on most browsers. This is the essential job they are designed to do. 

Apart from using standard HTML software, what matters in the end is how well the site runs, is it fast, and the presentation good - easy to read, and to navigate - and is the content is presenting your services or goods in the way you would like to be represented. 

The expense of paying an expert will be in the end to your advantage. Do be prepared to ask questions: such as how much it will cost in maintenance and how much will new pages cost to publish? And, at what point will it need a complete rewrite? Because web capabilities and the technologies are changing at a very fast rate. In 2021, we are at a watershed because of key new ways of doing things on the web are coming into place, which will allow a faster and smoother experience, as well as the ability to create new kinds of sites.


So can you make a D-I-Y website in Wordpress? Yes. But it will certainly be better to employ a professional, if you have the budget. Wordpress is still a good option if you have no money, but will you have the time and the skills?

## The future
While Wordpress may do the job, it is technology that is probably likely to become less popular over time, as companies such as Netlify now offer more flexible and easier to update packages.
