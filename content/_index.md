I have worked as a web developer since the early 1990s and over the past 30 plus years, I've observed the very rapid development of web technologies - with many new programming languages coming forward, as well as some which have become less popular.

I started my journey in photography at age 15, with a Kodak Instamatic, and shooting in Black and White Ilford film. I soon moved to a more advanced camera, eventually taking up the Rollieflex, which had been used by many famous photographers, and was still being used by everyday press photographers into the 1970s. 

Currently, I use a Fujifilm XT-2 mirrorless. But I still have Nikon 35mm manual and an old Mayima RB67 which weighs a few kilos and is best used on a stout tripod.
