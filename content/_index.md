I am a freelance web developer, having worked in the industry since the early 1990s. Over the past 30 plus years, I've observed the very rapid development of web technologies - with many new programming languages coming forward, as well as some which have become less popular.

Currently, I work on building community websites, and helping others to build their own sites using the available free hosting resources now offered. Communities are going to become more important as successive governments - at least in the UK - roll-back directly resourcing and running support services, and expecting the voluntary sector to come in and do the heavy lifting.

If you are looking to support your voluntary or charity operations with a web presence, or if your website needs a refresh, please get in touch by filling in the form on my Contact page, and I will get back to you.
