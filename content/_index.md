I've been working in print publishing and then digital media most of my career. Up until the mid-1990s, I was a production editor on weekly trade and technical newspapers, and I also edited monthly magazines, from artificial intelligence to desktop publishing. In 1995 I set up a website for a weekly newspaper for electronic design engineers and was given the pointy-hat title of *Webmaster* - highly popular at the time.

Since leaving the publishing industry, I've worked in consultancy and freelanced as a web developer. Over the past 30 plus years, I've observed the very rapid development of web technologies - with many new programming languages coming forward, as well as some which have become less popular.

Smartphones now dominate how we access websites - if you can even still call them websites, because many are highly-complex applications, and that complexity will continue to grow rapidly.

Currently, I work on building community websites, and helping others to build their own sites using the available free hosting resources now offered. Communities are going to become more important as successive governments - at least in the UK - roll-back directly resourcing and running support services, and expecting the voluntary sector to come in and do the heavy lifting.

For example, foodbank use has grown by 128% in the last five years - says the [Russell Trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/), which is a major foodbank support organisation. And this is just one sector where voluntary and charities will have to step up.

If you are looking to support your voluntary or charity operations with a web presence, or if your website needs a refresh, please get in touch by filling in the form on my Contact page, and I will get back to you.
