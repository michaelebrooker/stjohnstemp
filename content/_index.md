I've been working in print publishing and then digital media most of my career. Up until the mid-1990s, I was a production editor on weekly technical newspapers, and I edited monthly magazines, from artificial intelligence to desktop publishing. In 1995 I set up a website for a weekly newspaper for electronic design engineers and was given the pointy-hat title of *Webmaster* - highly popular at the time. 

Since leaving the publishing industry, I've worked in consultancy and freelanced as a web developer. Since the mid-1990s I've observed the very rapid development of web technologies - with many new programming languages coming forward, as well as some regressing. 

Smartphones now dominate how we access websites - if you can even still call them websites, because many are highly-complex applications, and that complexity will continue to grow rapidly.
