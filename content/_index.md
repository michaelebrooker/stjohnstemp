I have been a web developer since 1995 and I still enjoy coding as much as ever. My background is in publishing and I have worked as an editor and production editor on weekly and monthly technical newspapers and magazines, as well as some consumer titles. This site is just really no more than a blog for my own edification or anyone who happens on it and likes it or finds some interest here. 

I'm currently working on websites using Hugo - not Boss - but the static site generator. For many years, many websites have been dynamic, with back-end databases containing all the pages/data, and apps such as Wordpress and Drupal have been the leaders in content managed sites. But back in the 90s, most sites were static HTML pages, with no dynamic content, as any scripting might overload a server, which was in my company's case an expensive Sun SparcStation with often no back-up. So there are some that might wonder why the regression? 

The ecosystem early on was benign compared to the sophisticated criminal networks of today, so that any server running any scripts was not as vulnerable. Today, regardless of how much effort goes into trying to prevent exploits, static pages, at least for sites that are mainly text with images, offer an advantage of being more difficult to hack, and the server serves pages much more quickly when it doesn't have to process scripts to generate a page. The same advantage as 25 years ago. 

Of course, you could easily build a static site generator in Perl, or PHP and many did. But for some time, dynamic was cooler than static, and especially when Javascript, the default browser scripting language, was unreliable, or differences in the way browsers interpreted Javascript. At that time is was just more reliable to use a server-side script, say for HTML form validation.  

Now, Javascript, or more properly, Node.js is a very popular server-side programming language too, and for sites that need to do lots of agregating content from many sources it's pretty much becoming king of that hill. 

Many won't know that Javascript for server-side programming is a return to the past, because Netscape, venders of the original Web Browser, also made servers which used an earlier form of Javascript, which was rather awkward to use, compared to any modern version of the language. 

Nowadays, it certainly makes sense to use the same language in the browser as on the server: obvious synergies, if you want to build real-time data websites or single-page applications.
