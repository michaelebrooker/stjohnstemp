I've been working in print publishing and then digital media most of my career, later on as a production editor of weekly technical newspapers, editing monthly magazines, from artificial intelligence to desktop publishing, and on medical to construction titles. In 1995 I set up a website for a weekly newspaper for electronic design engineers and was given the pointy-hat title of **Webmaster** - highly popular at the time. 

Since then, I've worked in consultancy and freelanced as a web developer and producer. Since the mid-1990s I've observed the very rapid development of web technologies - many new programming languages. I was at the London press launch of Microsoft's web browserhandhh the advent of smartphones which now dominate how we access websites - if you can even still call them that, because many are highly-complex applications and that complexity will continue to grow rapidly.

### What else?
I'm thankful to many people who have helped and mentored me along the way, both in the professional spheres and in my other areas of interest, and particularly so in music.
