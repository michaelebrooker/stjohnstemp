I have been a web developer since 1995 and I still enjoy coding as much as ever. My background is in publishing and I have worked as an editor and production editor on weekly and monthly technical titles. This site is just really no more than a blog for my own edification or anyone who happens on it and likes it. If you don't like it, or anything here, you are still most welcome. 

I'm currently working on websites using Hugo, not Boss, but the static site generator. Many websites are dynamic, with databases containing all the pages/data, and apps such as Wordpress and Drupal are the leaders in content managed sites.
