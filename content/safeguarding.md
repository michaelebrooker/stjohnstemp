St John's Church Council takes its duty of care for children, young people and vulnerable adults attending worship or other activities at church seriously.
 
St John’s is subject to the ***Derby Diocese Safeguarding Children and Young People Policies and Procedures***, and works closely with the diocese to ensure good practice. Safeguarding advice and resources can be found on the Derby Diocese website.

Enhanced Disclosure and Barring  Service checks are completed on all those working with our children, young people and in the wider ministries associated with vulnerable adults. There is a regular programme of on-going Safeguarding training provided by the safeguarding team at the Diocese, for those involved in these activities. If you have any concerns about the safety of children at St Johns then email in confidence to safeguardingchildren@stjohnswalton.co.uk

#### Church of England Past Case Review 2 (PSR2)
Along with every other parish across the country we are participating in the Church of England PSR2.
Protocols and practice guidance for the Church of England’s Past Cases Review 2, (PCR2) have been published and are on the National Church of England Website.
http://churchofengland.org/safeguarding/promoting-safer-church/safeguarding-news-statements/past-cases-review-2

Individual survivors who wish to make representations to the PCR2 process in the Diocese or who need  to come forward with information or make any disclosures regarding church related abuse are encouraged to make direct contact with the Safeguarding Team 01332 388678. 

However, recognising that this may not feel safe for those with experience of abuse from within the church,  a dedicated national helpline - 0800 80 20 20 - operated independently from the church, by the NSPCC, was set up in September 2019 and remains available. Survivors and victims can use the helpline to provide information or to raise concerns regarding abuse within the Church of England context; whether they are reporting issues relating to children, adults or seeking to  whistle blow about poor safeguarding practice. 

Survivors were  not invited to contribute to the 2007-2009 PCR and the Church has wanted to ensure a different, trauma informed approach is taken by PCR2. Listening to survivor voices has helped to shape how this review will be conducted.
