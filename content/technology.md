There are many ways of building and deploying websites, and perhaps the best known is the venerable ***Wordpress*** which is written in the PHP language and now has the largest user base. 

But I particularly like the ***[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org)*** 
{{<floatimageright img="/img/jamstack_250.png" text="Jamstack Logo" >}}
concept because of its better security, faster speed, and that for a community organisation, small company, or individual, it can be free to use, and unlike other 'free' offers, it should not bug your readers by injecting annoying advertisement banners, or worse, videos.

And deployment on ***Netlify*** is free and Netlify uses an rather neat CMS - *content management system* - allows easy editing of the pages and pictures. What's not to like?

Jamstack makes use of ***static site generators*** which is the revival of a really old way of doing things early on in web, because at that time, shared servers were slow, and this got around the problem.

##### Netlify/Jamstack example commercial sites:

[rewild](https://www.rewild.org) - Wildlife conservation


[Danone](https://www.danone.com) and [Nike](https://nike.com) are just two very large companies.
