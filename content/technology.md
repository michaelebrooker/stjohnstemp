## Websites - what are they?
Once upon a time this question was very easy to answer. In [Tim Berners-Lee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)  (inventor of the ***World Wide Web***) original concept it was pages of text - no images - with document structures, such has headings, paragraphs, and quotations. And later on tables and images could be added to pages, but essentially it remained the same thing: documents - pages of text. 

Nowadays, websites are many different types of things. **Google Maps** is an application in a web browser, or running on a dedicated app on a smartphone. It doesn't represent a text documents. The complexity of what we see in our browser windows, and on our smartphone browsers, or smartphone apps, gets increasingly sophisticated and this trend will continue. 

But the original idea of pages of text remains, with images, and not much else for many websites. And that means it is still possible to build a website in purely HTML if you wished to. The problem with this approach is that of being able to maintain the content in the site without all that HTML code getting in the way. 

An answer to that problem is Wordpress, and there are thousands of sites on the web using Wordpress. But sometimes old ideas lose traction, and more efficient and elegant solutions come along. And one of those is something called [**Jamstack.**](https://jamstack.org)

For most websites that are mainly text, this is a very secure and flexible way of creating websites. 

In many respects, Wordpress over-complicates the process, because it makes the server run code, is far more vulnerable to being tricked into delivering malicious code to users browsers. A **Jamstack** uses the latest website technologies and has the advantage, certainly for small and community website merely sends a copy of the web page being requested. And Jamstack websites can take advantage of free web hosting. Like Wordpress, the pages can still be created and edited by those who don't have web programming skills. What's not to like?
