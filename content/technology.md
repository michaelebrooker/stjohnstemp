# You want to learn to web programming?
## Which technologies are going to get you ahead of the game?
### Javascript / Node
Javascript has been around since the early days, when it wasn't very flexible and only had very basic functionality. It was initially used as as a client-side language in the browser, but Netscape also deployed it early on as a server-side language for its proprietary web servers.

Javascripts ascendency in recent years as a server-side language has been driven by the node.js implementation that runs on desktop machines, providing command line web development tools, such as Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, and of course it runs on servers. There are obvious synergies for running the same language in the browser, and on the server. A major feature of node is its ability to handle concurrent connections very efficiently, something that PHP currently lacks.

Javascript has the Express framework, which is worth a look, and it has a number static site generators, such as Next.js, and Nuxt. As well as static sites, it's the key technology in single page application frameworks, such as Vue.js and AngularJS.

### Java
Java is not the same at Javascript - it's a different language that uses a compiler. It is still running on plenty of web servers, and has been the backbone of delivering business logic in financial systems for many years and shows no sign of being left behind.

### PHP 
A language still worth learning, and still very widely used. And since Wordpress is written in PHP, it's certainly worth the biscuit in learning to use it. Wordpress will be around for a while yet, but there is a danger that unless it's completely re-written, perhaps in node or Golang, it may become less dominant than it is currently. How many new apps are being built in PHP is not clear, since Javascript and node.js are growing strongly. 

### Laravel - PHP framework
Yes, Laravel - the pre-eminent PHP framework - seems awesome. No-one could not be impressed by its capabilities. Is it going to be the future? Is it more than just a protopying system? These are difficult questions to answer. And what of all the other PHP frameworks and that Laravel has dependencies on, such as Symfony?

### Golang and Hugo
Golang shows a lot of promise as a programming language for the web, and its now quite mature, and has advantages over other competitors. Like Node.js, it's another technology developed by Google Hugo
