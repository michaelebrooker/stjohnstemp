We particularly like ***[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org)*** 
{{<floatimageright img="/img/jamstack_250.png" text="Jamstack Logo" >}}
because of its better security, faster speed, and that for a community organisation, small company, or individual it can be free to use, and unlike other 'free' websites, it doesn't bug your readers by injecting annoying advertisement banners, or worse, videos.

***Jamstack*** is able to use [Netlify's](https://netlify.com) free tier CDN hosting, even with your own domain 
name.

***Wordpress*** remains highly-popular, and for many good reasons, and has been the de-facto blog system for many years. 

### What is a website?
Once upon a time this question was very easy to answer. In [Tim Berners-Lee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)  (inventor of the ***World Wide Web***) original concept it was pages of text - no images - with document structures, such has headings, paragraphs, and quotations. And later on tables and images could be added to pages, but essentially it remained the same thing: documents - pages of text.

Nowadays, websites are many different types of things. **Google Maps** is an *application* in a web browser, or running on a dedicated app on a smartphone. It is not pages of text. The complexity of what we see in our browser windows, and on our smartphone browsers, or smartphone apps, gets increasingly sophisticated and this trend will continue. But the original idea of pages of text and images remains, and that is what the majority of websites still are.
