# You want to learn to web programming?
## Which technologies are going to get you ahead of the game?
### Javascript / Node
Javascript has been around since the early days, when it wasn't very flexible and only had very basic functionality. It was initially for use as a client-side language in the browser, but Netscape also used it early on as a server-side language for its proprietary web servers. Javascripts ascendency in recent years as a server-side language has been driven by the node.js implementation that runs on desktop machines, providing command line tools, and on servers. And there are obvious synergies for running the same language in the browser, and on the server. A major feature of node is it's ability to handle concurrent connections very efficiently, something that PHP currently lacks - see below.
Javascript has the Express framework, which is worth a look.

### PHP 
A language still worth learning, and still very widely used - in Wordpress. And since Wordpress is written in PHP, it's certainly worth the biscuit in learning to use it. Wordpress will be around for a while yet, but there is a danger that unless it's completely re-written, perhaps in node or Golang, it may become less dominant that it is currently. How many new apps are being built in PHP is not clear, since Javascript and node.js are growing strongly. 

#### Laravel - PHP framework
Yes, Laravel seems awesome. No-one could not be impressed by its capabilities and rich automated systems. Is it going to be the future? Is it more than just a protopying system? These are difficult questions to answer. And what of all the other PHP frameworks and that Laravel has dependencies on, such as Symfony?

#### Golang and Hugo
Golang shows a lot of promise as a programming language for the web, and its now quite mature, and has advantages over other competitors. Hugo
