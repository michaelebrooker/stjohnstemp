There are many ways of building and deploying websites, and perhaps the best known is the venerable ***Wordpress***. But I particularly like the ***[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org)*** 
{{<floatimageright img="/img/jamstack_250.png" text="Jamstack Logo" >}}
concept because of its better security, faster speed, and that for a community organisation, small company, or individual, it can be free to use, and unlike other 'free' offers, it should not bug your readers by injecting annoying advertisement banners, or worse, videos.

And ***Netlify's*** CMS - *content management system* - allows easy editing of the pages and pictures. What's not to like?

##### Netlify/Jamstack examples:

And large companies: 

[Danone](https://www.danone.com) and [Nike](https://nike.com) are just two examples.
