## Sundays
#### Morning 9:00 am
This service follows the traditional pattern of Holy Communion, with hymns from *Songs of Fellowship*, and is followed by morning coffee in the Church Centre afterwards. Whether you are a regular communicant or simply enjoy a traditional experience of worship, you will be very warmly welcome to join us.

#### Morning 10:45 am
With a varied pattern of worship across the month, 1045 is characterised by a relaxed approach and a mixture of sung worship led by the band, with liturgy and song words and media projected on both sides of the church.

Across three weeks of the month, this service hosts a full range of activities for children and young people, from creche facilities for the very youngest, through to teenage years and beyond.

The Family Celebration is also followed by coffee and other drinks, sometime even cakes.

#### Evening 7:30 pm
***Just Be*** is a gentle time of worship, prayer, reflection and mutual encouragement.

## Tuesdays
#### Morning: 11:00 am
Tuesday Worship is more than simply a time of worship together; from the beginning, friendship with Jesus has been an experience of community.

Jesusâ€™ final time of fellowship with His disciples was a meal where, with broken bread and a cup of wine, and the heart of Tuesday Worship is a meal we share together following the service. 

#### Evening: Prayer Life 7:30pm
Join us for our weekly evening prayer gathering for a time of listening to God and attentive prayer.
