## Tuesdays
#### Evening 11:00 am
Tuesday Worship is more than simply a time of worship together; from the beginning, friendship with Jesus has been an experience of community.

Jesusâ€™ final time of fellowship with His disciples was a meal where, with broken bread and a cup of wine, and the heart of Tuesday Worship is a meal we share together following the service. 

#### Prayer Life 7:30pm
