The death of someone we love can be one of the most stressful and devastating events of our lives. It is a shocking and bewildering experience and not something to be ‘got over’ in a matter of weeks or months.

St John’s offers support through this difficult time, helping and enabling the saying of goodbyes, and walking alongside people as they begin to live with their loss.

We have ministers available to lead funeral services either at St John’s or at the Crematorium. Please ask your funeral director to contact us. A minister will then arrange to meet with you to talk about the style of service that will suit your needs best.

Following the funeral, a member of our Bereavement Team will contact you to see if there is any other way in which we can help. Our Bereavement Team members are fully trained and DBS checked.

If you would like to contact our Bereavement Team for support; whether the funeral of your loved one was conducted by St John’s or not, or whether your bereavement was recent or not, please contact the church office at 01246 566205 (Mon-Thur 9am - 1pm).
