## Websites - what are they?
Once upon a time this question was very easy to answer. In [Tim Berners-Lee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)  (inventor of the ***World Wide Web***) original concept it was pages of text - no images - with document structures, such has headings, paragraphs, and quotations. And later on tables and images could be added to pages, but essentially it remained the same thing: documents - pages of text.

Nowadays, websites are many different types of things. **Google Maps** is an *application* in a web browser, or running on a dedicated app on a smartphone. It is not pages of text. The complexity of what we see in our browser windows, and on our smartphone browsers, or smartphone apps, gets increasingly sophisticated and this trend will continue.

But the original idea of pages of text remains, with images, and not much else for many websites which are informational. It is still possible to build an information-based website in purely HTML if you wish to. The problem with this approach is that of being able to maintain the content in the site without all that HTML code getting in the way.

An answer to that problem has been Wordpress, and there are thousands of sites on the web using Wordpress. But technology has moved on and more efficient and elegant solutions beckon, such as something called [**Jamstack.**](https://jamstack.org) 
For most websites that are mainly text, this is a very secure and flexible way of creating websites.

In many respects, Wordpress over-complicates the process, because it makes the server run code for every page, and therefore is far more vulnerable to being tricked into delivering malicious code to users. **Jamstack** uses the latest website technologies and has the advantage of merely sending a copy of the web page being requested which is faster too.

And Jamstack websites can take advantage of free web hosting. Like Wordpress, the pages can still be created and edited by those who don't have web programming skills, using a Content Management System. What's not to like? 

And if you are totally wedded to Wordpress, there is software to allow it to be placed on modern hosting servers, which are called Content Delivery Networks, or CDNs.
