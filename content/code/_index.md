## Hugo
Is a great static site generator and is my default web development platform these days. It's based on the Go language, which is yet another computer programming language. How many do we need? Golang has some awesome features, and to get under the skin of Hugo, you probably need to get a grasp of Hugo's idiosyncratic mode of programming

## Wordpress
It's been around for ages and is a bit long in the tooth by now. But it's very widely used and many people who are not technical can use it. Yes, it can be vulnerable, and perhaps awkward with Bootstrap. 

## Boostrap (5)
It has its critics of course. But there's a lot to like and not a lot to not like. Bootstrap is not by any means perfect but neither are any other of the CSS frameworks. One very light alternative is WC3 CSS which I like too, and is certainly very usable and appropriate for community websites.
