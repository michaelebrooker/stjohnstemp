It's been possible to run a linux shell/sub-system on Windows for a few years now, and this has been a welcome development. This is very handy for web development, and you can run the vim editor if you like that sort of thing - which I do. I've always been a vi person rather than Emacs.

I've never liked the Windows Command shell, and only ever tolerated it probably because I started with the Bourne Shell and got quite familiar with it. Then there's Powershell, which is really for dedicated Windows pro admins and geeks. 

I've have to admit that I've never really much liked Windows, for so many reasons, but today, it is a much better operating system than it ever has been, and the Linux shell is a great addition. There is no perfect operating system.
