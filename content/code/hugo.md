Is a great static site generator and what I use to run this site. It'|s based on the Go language, which is yet another computer programming language. How many do we need? But Golang has some great new ideas, and to get under the skin of Hugo, you probably need to get a grasp of Hugo's idiosyncratic mode of programming

Hugo's basic idea is very simple to make everything really simple on the server so it can not be impeded with any unnecessary code running on the server. Of course we have to handle form submissions with a server-side language. 

The initialisation of a new Hugo site leaves you with quite a bit to do in order to get it setup, even with the themes, which are very helpful. It's a very basic site without a theme, but archetypes, and config are not included in the theme structure. And resources for Bootstrap or other HMTL framework sit outside the theme's structure. 

Seems to me it would great to have everything in the theme, and still leave the defaults in place in the main director structure. 

1. write the config.toml file to your specification
2. install a theme, with custom templates
3. create an assets file
4. customise your archetypes default.md front matter
