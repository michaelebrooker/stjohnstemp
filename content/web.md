### The early years

It's more than 30 years since Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of a web. It started as simple text pages, and folders - or more properly: directories -  containing them. So it was the directory structure that determined the way the information was organised. Simple.

A website was a static arrangement of text files - with a simple mark-up HTML, contained in folders. The user requested a page, and the server sent a copy to the user.
