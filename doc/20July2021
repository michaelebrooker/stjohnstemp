# set up for Github and netlify

I set up micdoc on github, and then linked it to Netlify, but it did not appear. 

Issue one is my build command is hugo, which would be ok if I had not made public the publish directory thinking that I would not let Netlify build my site, but instead just upload the public folder contents, keeping control of the build myself. 

Then I turned off the build command. Let's do it in stages.
