      <h1>WWW history</h1>
      <h3 id="the-early-years">The early years</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than 30 years since Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of the World Wide Web. It started as simple text pages, and folders - or more properly: directories -  containing them. So it was the directory structure that determined the way the information was organised. Simple.</p>
<p>A website was a static arrangement of text files - with a simple mark-up HTML, contained in folders. The user requested a page, and the server sent a copy to the user.</p>
<p>Hypercard was a neat little app on Apple Macs in the 1987s. It had it&rsquo;s on programming language: Hypertalk. Kind of graphics with text card index, with &lsquo;hyperlinks&rsquo; between them. Nearest thing today would be Evernote, I should think.</p>
<h3 id="html---the-starting-point">HTML - the starting point</h3>
<p>In 1995 when the web was starting to make it into the national news, <strong>HTML 2.0</strong> had just superseded HTML 1.2, and we had dial-up modems on our desks to upload content, which was written as static html pages in BBEdit on a Mac. And it wasn&rsquo;t tool long after this that server-side includes arrived, which did help greatly with maintaining menus across a larger website. A server-side include allowed the server to inject a portion of HTML with navigation into any page.</p>
<p><strong>HTML 3.2</strong> was next innovation, and it absorbed Netscape&rsquo;s style tags, which allowed font attributes and wider use of background colours and tables to be used. Without these style tags, you could not define colours or any font styles.</p>
<p><strong>HTML 4.0</strong> came in with something called <strong>frame sets</strong> which divided the browser window into different sections, each with their own HTML content, so you could say have navigation column which appeared fixed on all pages. Footers could be treated the same way. And we experimented with these for a while, but back, and forward buttons, <em><strong>de riguer</strong></em> on almost every website&rsquo;s navigation at that time, became awkard. The user&rsquo;s browser might be confused about which pane is to go forward or back. So frames fell from favour in time.</p>
<p><strong>XHTML 1.0</strong> was next innovation and gained widespread adoption as it was supposed to a universal mark-up language for all devices, but fell short, as mobile devices with highly redimentary &lsquo;browser&rsquo; with a subset HTML appeared. A feature of XHTML was enforce end tags to be present.</p>
<p>Alongside XHTML 1.0, <strong>HTML 4.0</strong> was developed and promoted to be the definitive web mark-up language for at least some time, but in 2014 <strong>HTML 5.0</strong> and the then latest <strong>CSS</strong> were finally able to allow separation data from presentation.</p>
<h3 id="server-side">Server-side</h3>
<p>Early server-side code was writen in shell languages and then <strong>Perl</strong>. I really liked perl and miss it quite frankly. It was quirky, fun, with an ethos of unoppinionated, but could lead to spaghetti code if you were not disciplined. Lots of large sites ran it: <em><strong>The Guardian</strong></em> newspaper, and the <em><strong>BBC</strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>PHP</strong> was described to me once as server-side includes on steroids, and in it&rsquo;s early version PHP was very easy to written, spitting out errors into your browser, bringing paramatres submitted by users on page without sanitation, which led to trouble, before it grew up somewhat and came to dominate the server-side sphere, and even now is still widely used, despite very many other great web languages, such as Ruby, and Python, just to name two.</p>
